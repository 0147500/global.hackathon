Pierce Stegman

I am a Junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.  When I was 7, my dad bought me a book on HTML.  I stated coding basic websites, but I wanted to do more.  A few years later, my parents bought me Adobe CS4, and I began to make Flash games.  As I made games, I often asked myself how I could make games that helped people.  At first I began to make educational games, but after a while, I decided I wanted to make things other than education games.  I began to learn different languages as I looked into different things that I could make.  In the process, I learned PHP, JavaScript, C++, C#, and recently HTML5.  I also took an interest in artificial intelligence.  Some examples of projects I made are a cryptocurrency exchange, an AI that learned to identify cyber bullying on Facebook, a system that let you deploy code via email, and a GUI wallet for Dashcoin, a cryptonote currency.

I am most skilled with backend development, artificial intelligence, and crytocurrencies.  I have an idea that will make use of AI to make reading the TOS and Terms and Conditions on a website not only fast, but easy and fun.
