Pierce Stegman

I am a Junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.  I stated coding websites and Flash games at 7.  A couple years ago I turned primarily to working on more useful things.  Some examples are a cryptocurrency exchange, an AI that learned to identify cyber bullying on Facebook, a system that let you deploy code via email, and a GUI wallet for Dashcoin, a cryptonote currency.


About your skills and what you are going to do?

I am most skilled with backend development, artificial intelligence, and crytocurrencies.  I have an idea that will make use of AI to make reading the TOS and Terms and Conditions on a website not only fast, but easy and fun.
