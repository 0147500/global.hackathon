The only one thing that hade grouped this cvartet are AD&D. Past some weekends thay had figured out that thay had another one common interest - programming. This was the fate. Passion for programming and role-playingmade it's diel. And thay unite the team. This team do all it's best to make a critical hit. 1d20 FTW!
