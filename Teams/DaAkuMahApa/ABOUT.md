Dhi is a baker at http://rockybars.com, while Irfan is a university student. We're motivated to get involved to push the limit of ourselves, that we can give something to the *universe*!

Dhi loves to code in c++, and also javascript (who doesn't love javascript?), especially on top of nodejs. 
Irfan very good in php, html5, css and also javascript. He loves to play with frontend thingy.

What you are going to do?
