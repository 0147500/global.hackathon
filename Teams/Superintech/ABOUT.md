We are a team of designers & developers. In short - We are GEEKS from the future!!

We have joined the hackathon to contribute our share to the community. If we win it will not be just for the sake of name & fame BUT so that we can invest it into our further developing ideas. We are small team short on funds & we are desperately looking for some help. We have lot of ideas developing from the last 7 years of working in different streams. But they are still ideas as they never developed into concepts. If we win this, we are definitely going to get moving forward from here. Fingers crossed!!


Our Team Skills & Background:
=======================

Vijayinder (a.k.a: VJ): I started my coding journey 7 years back with .net technology. After few years of struggling & going through different technologies, I finally ended up on php. Which lead me learning WordPress as a platform. Since then it has been a great experience of learning from scratch to being an expert in WordPress theme development. I now have knowledge of WordPress Responsive Theme development -> Joomla as a platform -> Magento Theme Development as well.
I am working with a great team that I have combined after years of working together & trust. We are taking multiple projects monthly, especially related to development of wordpress themes & portfolios. Apart from that I have also trained myself in Internet Marketing Techniques, as well as I have knowledge of adwords and adroll just to assist clients with their businesses when needed.

Sneha (a.k.a: Mam): Hi there!! My name is Sneha Samfrancisco, I'm graphic designer & web developer working in this field for more than 7 years. Till date I have designed & developed a wide range of websites including: E-commerce websites, Business websites, Landing pages. The web designing & development technologies that I am expert at using include: Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML5/CSS3, Corel Draw X4. Open source platforms that I have expertise includes: WordPress, Magento, Joomla, Prestashop etc. I love working with new challenges. I believe in communication & my belief is that "Communication is the key to a successful Project" So let's start achieving success..!!

Swapnil (a.k.a: Neal): I started my career as an Mech Engineer with ACC Cement limited, where I was selected from campus placement. It was a great experience as I was part of project team for almost 3 years. In all these times, my actual interest remained in designing softwares such as Autocad. After a span of three years I decided to quit job with ACC and I started learning design and development. After 6 months of training from VJ & Sneha, learning the designing & development basics, tools as in Photoshop & Dreamweaver etc, I was all set with the industry standards and started working professionally as a freelancer designer & developer. Pretty soon work started to flow & now I am working on multiple projects for clients overseas. All these years, the experience of handling projects (planning & excuting) from the previous job, always came handy. It's been almost 3 years now working in the IT industry & it's been a really great journey so far. Looking forward to many more :)


What we are going to do?
=======================
We are in a bit of confusion at the current moment, when it comes to deciding what we are planning to create. But definitely we are planning to stick to the theme which will help support a global cause. And which will make things easier for the general public, when it comes to designing & coding. We'll be most probably using WordPress as a platform. As soon as we finalize the API's to be used, we'll update here. Thank you.
