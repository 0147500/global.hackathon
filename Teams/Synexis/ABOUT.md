## About Me

I have been fascinated with computers since I was four years old, and have been coding in various languages for over 20 years with an emphasis in web development.

While I have a vast general knowledge of modern technology in general, my areas of expertise are primarily related to LAMP, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, and ImageMagick, but I also have extensive experience in many other areas.
