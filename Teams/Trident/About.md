I am a web developer, systems engineer. I like to work on products and projects that are interactive and add value to common tasks. I like to make the web a better place for everyone. Projects that help people get things done are my favourite. I am always on the lookout for cool interactive web applications.I decided to join in on the global hackathon because i haven't been to a hackathon before and i really like the idea of a remote global hackathon taking place all over the world.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I am good with HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, PHP and Perl. I am still deciding on which theme to work on.
