About my team
===========================
Team member: Naglaa Eid (aka nageid or nag ;) )

I am a final year Software Engineering undergraduate student at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, ON, Canada. No, I am not frozen to death up here, but getting there.

Why I decided to join? As a busy student with finals this week, I decided to join a hackathon for the fun of it. And trust me, they are super fun. Ah, I feel the adrenaline already!!

Between CO-OPs and part-time jobs, I have around 2.5 years of software experience. With an engineering degree, you'd think  when do I have time? And I don't. That's why I am joining this hackathon. After 5 years of studying engineering and filling my resume with high-tech jobs. I realized I want more "hackthony" experience ... yes, I joined a local hackathon or too but they are usually on long weekend and noone shows up, so everyone goes back home after pizza. But, I did join one hackathon by Facebook and it was the BEST thing ever. After that, I started treating all my assignments as hackthons. Pfff of course, I don't leave them till the last minute just so I am forced to pull an all-nighter and get it all working from scratch fully functional with extra features just for fun. No! ... Yes, yes I do. It feels so AWESOME to create something spectacular in a heck of a sleepless night.
