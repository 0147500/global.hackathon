We are a bunch of geeks who love to learn and master software development technologies. We are more than we are. We are ONE.

## About Us

- Abdush loves Java since he started to write his first code in this programming language. He formerly worked on several projects to provide software solutions with optimum algorithms in Sudan. He is regarded as expert by his friends due to his prominent experience in software and managerial skills. In his free time, you can find him talking with his friends or doing sport activities.
- Dommy has more than 5 years experience of professional software development in 2 different countries. He has been fallen in love with .NET since he learned how to write "Hello World!" program. Python - his second love - took his heart recently. In his spare time, Dommy enjoys watching football matches with his friends and arguing about some stupid things.

He was part of the Startup team working on the project called "Virtual Education System", which has been acquired by three large universities in Azerbaijan. In his spare time, Elchin likes playing chess and brainstorming with his friends.
- Halim loved Java before, but after years of playing with many different programming languages, he just doesn't have any tendency towards any specific programming language anymore. His greatest dream is to meet with a programming language or framework that can handle cross language problem. But what defines him most, Halim loves Manchester United. XD
- Ruvin has been learning problem-solving algorithms since he was in the first year. His love for algorithm brought him national and international recognitions.
