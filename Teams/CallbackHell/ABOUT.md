About your team
===========================

We have a junior coder and one not junior any more, and one with some experience.The whole team works with JavaScript, and we think we can do amazing things with JavaScript. We never worked all together on the same project, so this is going to be a challenge, but we're looking forward to it. 

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
The team lead is a Node.js developer and Node.js really does great in doing network requests and putting all the stuff together. The rest of the team also has Node.js experience, so we're going to pull in a lot of JavaScript.

The idea is to create a mesh of the existing public APIs and gather publicly available data and create a useful dashboard for displaying and manipulating this data. We want to pull in as much data as we can and then show it in an interesting way
