"I am a very passionate person. I get excited over small things. And coding is my huge passion. 
I love the world of numbers, where creativity and imagination can do whatever we want. I just 
command the directions.. and the code.. It gets in right place. All of us can do this. You just have to know 
the secret in imagination. ;)

The tools that help me express my ideas: 
.NET,
C#, C++, C, Python, Javascript, HTML5,
ASP .NET MVC 5, Web API, Entity Framework, Google Map Web API, CSS..

I love doing magic with my team. We go off the Earth very often together and this time stars are our destination."
