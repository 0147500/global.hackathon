================

This is my first hackathon and I have entered as a solo participant. 
I want to challenge myself and see if I can take a concept from idea to execution in 48 hours by myself. 
Above all, I'm hoping to have some fun, learn some new things, and be amazed at what everyone creates!



My programming skills
=======
I am proficient in Java. I developed enterprise web applications with Primefaces. It is irrelevant in this event but I have 5 year experience with Android development.


I am planning to do something on Tomcat. I checked and it worked on koding.com vpn.
