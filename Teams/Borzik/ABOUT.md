About me
===========================

I'm full stack web developer from Ukraine, and I've worked for more than 1000 hours at oDesk already. I love what I do.

#### Languages I use:
- Ruby
- Javascript
- Go

#### Frameworks:
- Ruby on Rails
- Backbone.js
- and others...

There is nothing special to say about the application which will be built, however I'm going to use some great APIs to deliver new interesting solution for cross-language communicating.
