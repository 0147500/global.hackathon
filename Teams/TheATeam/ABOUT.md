A hackathon is always great motivation to jump-start a project!

About me
===========================
Name's Frank. I'll be working (probably by myself) on a simple idea that I've been brewing. Wanna know what it is? Guess you'll have to wait and see when I get around to putting it together.

About your skills and what you are going to do?

My day-job is in robotics, and we can leave it at that. I do, however, have a background in web-dev essentials.
