# KawaiiDesuDevs

We are two high-school students (and maybe the only ones in this hackatoon) from Brazil.
We decided to get this awful name due to our lack of imagination (actually, we just think we are too hot, and saw a bunch of animes before applying to the event)

## What we're will create

[Moving forward, it's time to act with 24/7 skillsets and leverage our team paradigms.](http://projects.wsj.com/buzzwords2014/#p=7|37,33|18|0|||2) We actually don't have much of an idea on what to do, but we will get it up sometime.
