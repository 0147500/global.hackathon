J-Unit
================

We are Ali and Bobby, a strong developer / designer team. Ali is located in Lahore,
Pakistan, while Bobby is in Boston, U.S.

We met during work a few months ago. Due to our complimentary skills and good work chemistry,
we decided we'd be the dream team for going into this hackathon together.

About us
===========================
Our team has a yin/yang philosophy. Bobby, the yin, does all the design, CSS,
and UX work. Ali, the yang, does the backend programming to bring everything together.
This works great, as we have skills that compliment each others' weaknesses.

Our name, 'J-Unit', comes from our mutual love of hip hop and
Ali's love of unit testing, mixed with the fact that we use Java as our main programming language,
for both client and server side.

Our biggest motivation for participating in this hackathon, is so we can have a shot at an interview
with some of the awesome VCs which are on the judges' panel. Our dream is to do a startup,
and we have an awesome idea that we'd love to pitch.


Our Skills
=======
- Java
- [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org)
- CSS3
- HTML5
- PhoneGap

There will be a lot of teams that will be doing yet another CRUD app, or yet another
spin on some existing website. We hope to do something different, ambitious, and technically
hard to pull off. Something that should push our limits, both on the design and
development sides.
