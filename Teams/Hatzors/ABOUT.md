Team Hatzors!
=============

We are two grade 10 students in Canada, looking to see what we can do here. Together we are quite fluent in HTML/CSS/JS, python, and are learning Swift and dabbling in lots of other languages.

We are:

#### Eden S.-G.
I mainly work on front-end, usually in `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS`. I also dabble in Blender, Inkscape and GIMP for design work. I put some of my work [here](http://edensg.me/), and I have a bunch of design/visuals [here](http://edensg.me/files.html) and [here](https://edensg.github.io/) (haven’t updated this last one in a while). I’ve been exploring `Jekyll` and `SASS`, and have been using tools like `Node.JS` and `Ruby` for a while now.

I was introduced to coding in grade four by an awesome teacher I had — he had a bunch of Commodore 64s in the classroom and taught the entire class the basics of `BASIC`. I ended up making text-based adventures, lottery/probability games, and even a conversation engine (it didn’t say much, but it did work). The next year I made a full game of Asteroids in Scratch, complete with X, Y and rotational momentum and acceleration, and asteroid splitting. I since have taught myself `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS` through Codecademy, and have started making an online version of [Vector 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20131115042508/http://playthisthing.com/vector-3) with Three.JS. I have contributed code for Fight For the Future, have made interactive online infographics for school projects, and have attended a local hackathon for Global Hack Day.

#### Michael Barker
I am 15 years old, and have been programming since I was 11. I have been taught Java 8 and Python 3 at school, but have pursued many other languages on my own time, including `C`, `C++`, `Objective-C`, and `Swift`, plus a few scripting languages, such as `Bash`, `Perl`, and `Ruby`. I got into scripting because I wanted to automate things that I did repeatedly, and that opened up doors to learning higher-level languages, rather than just scripting.

I am also very interested in Bitcoin. I have been mining Bitcoin since May of this year, and I’ve made about 0.4 BTC (about 168 CAD as of the time of writing). I think that cryptocurrencies will be used a lot in the future — Cryptocurrencies cannot be controlled by any central agency, so the value of the currency cannot be manipulated by the government to fit their own needs. Also, since they can easily be sent to anyone in the world no matter where they are, there would no longer be a need for currency exchange fees/inconvenience of exchanging currencies.

 I have also been runing a Tor relay, an I2P node, and a Freenet node (with 50GB of cache), contributing to three of the leading networks that protect privacy and anonymity online.
