TNTeam

## Who we Are

Our team consists of a mix of experienced hacker veterans, promising
programming rising stars, and artists, all from Tunisia.  Some of us
know each other since quite a while now (Rafik and Mohamed were
classmates since high school), met during work (Rafik , Elyes and
Ibtissem are coworkers) or while attending Kendo training (Rafik and
Chakib are Kenshis). But all in all, TNTeam is made of only friends,
that share a deep love for hacking and love arts.

* `Rafik` and `Mohamed` are Back-End Developers and
architects. They'll probably will write Clojure and Java.
* `Ibtissem` is an experienced Front-End infrastructure engineer,
though also having her word to say on back-end side of things. She
knows a couple of things about Clojure, Java, HTML5 and JS.
* `Elyes` is a promising Web Developer, experienced in designing and
integrating cool web apps.

And here's what we all look like:

## So what are we cooking for you?

Still thinking about it. But it will surely be somthing special !
Very likely, we'll use some clojure, java, some html5/CSS3 magic... stay tuned !
