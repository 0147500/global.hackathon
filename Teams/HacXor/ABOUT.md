We are four students of **Delhi Technological University, New Delhi**, there is no single reason we love coding (but sure there are many :) its makes our work easier, daily problems interesting, make dull and monotonous tasks hell lot of fun), however we enjoy the way we can use it to solve real world problems. 



About your skills and what you are going to do?

Still brainstorming, probably best ideas always take little time to grow!
