I am Daniel Masterson, a second year university student at the University of Hull (UK) currently studying MEng Computer Science With Games Development. I have been interested in programming since the age of 9 where I dove straight in (and straight back out again) to C++. My life has lead me through many languages - PHP, JavaScript, UnrealScript and my all time favourite C#. I'm here to show people what I can do with a free weekend and a lot of JavaScript.

Here's my face:

## My Languages
Where to begin...
- C and C++
- C# (And a bit of Java)
- PHP
- JavaScript with JQuery
- UnrealScript (with the Unreal Development Kit)
- Visual Basic if the need arises
- A bunch of other things I've dabbled in like x86 Assembly, Python, Ruby and more esoteric languages. I even made a Befunge interpreter in HTML and JavaScript because...uh.
