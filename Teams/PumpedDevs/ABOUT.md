PumpedDevs
================
Hey! You've actually visited our page(?). We are pumpedDevs! We're thrilled to be part of the first Global Hackathon, well actually, this is the first hackthon for some of us. :)


About the team
===========================
Hi, we are **pumpedDevs**(pumped developers)! We're composed of 4 developers who loves to develop apps for mobile and web.

The team was already created months ago(*May 2014*) before **Koding's Global Hackathon**. The original members were me(Ron), Bryan, and a friend of mine(*Not in the team*). We formed this team because of some reasons and our main goal is to start our own. We wanted to build our own **start up**. Our problem is, *we don't have any idea how, also our **time** and **budget** won't allow us*. (We have full-time and part time jobs. Long story on why we can't quit any, but we can share if requested?)

The time we discovered the **hackathon**, we were so *excited*. But when we saw that there were only 1000 slots for the hackathon, the excitement went down since we think that it is impossible for us(me) to be chosen. But I still tried! I told them, "If we get chosen, I will treat you guys!". So eventually, I gave them a treat at a coffee shop(starbucks)!
