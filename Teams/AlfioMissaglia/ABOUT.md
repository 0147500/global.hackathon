#About me
Hello! I'm **Alfio Missaglia**, a  thirteen years old computer science student who lives in Venice, Italy.
I own the [www.missaglialfio.pw](https://www.missaglialfio.pw/) blog :)

I currently studying computer science at the *Carlo Zuccante* college of Mestre - a pretty little town close to Venice.

#My project
I would like to make a nice project based on theme 1 and 4, but I have to decide a lot of other things :)
>Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization.

>HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented.

#Languages
I'll probably use:
* PHP
* jQuery
* SQL (maybe [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) engine)
* Node.js
* HTML5
