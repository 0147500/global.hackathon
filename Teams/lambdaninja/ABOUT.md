# Lambda Ninja
I'm Hasan, a computer hacker from Egypt. 

## About

I programmed in many languages before. I really do love the idea of funcational programming
and it has managed to creep its way into my C programming.. Eek!

For prototyping I use processing, arduino and python. Since this is a hackathon, something tells
me I'll be coding in processing this hackathon!

## Quick overview of idea
A game.

Okay, that was too quick. :D
