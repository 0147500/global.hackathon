We are <b>Insomnia</b>
...a group of three coders from three different parts of the world.

We might be small as a team, but our will is great and lack of sleep can't bother us.


About your team
===========================

We are composed of three members, scattered across the world, who just recently met and banded for Koding's Hackathon. We also want to have fun and learn while coding and attempting to solve problems.

As a programmer, I've just been serious within the last year. I've taken courses on basic computer science and have had experience coding GUI game apps. At the moment, I only know Python and C++ but plan to expand this skillset while learning new experiences. I've also been wanting to work with everyone from all around the world. This Hackathon is the start of all of these!

Our skillset:
- Python
- HTML5
- Javascript

Our mission is to explore polluted new worlds, to seek out fresh air and blue sky, to boldly go where no excess CO2 has gone before. We aim to create a game app addressing one of the planet's challenges: air pollution.
