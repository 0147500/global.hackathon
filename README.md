## KODING'S GLOBAL VIRTUAL HACKATHON

Welcome to the git repo for Koding's Global Virtual Hackathon! If that 
does not ring a bell, please
[go here](https://koding.com/Hackathon). You can win more than $35,000 in 
prizes!

The purpose of this repo is two-fold:
* for us to share share sample code with you
* for you to share your team details and eventually your final project 
  code with us

#### DO THIS NOW!

Fork this repo and add a new folder in the existing "teams" folder. Name 
the folder with your team name and inside this folder, create two files:
* team.json (see [example file](https://github.com/koding/global.hackathon/blob/master/Teams/TeamKoders/team.json) for details)
* ABOUT.md (see [example file](https://github.com/koding/global.hackathon/blob/master/Teams/TeamKoders/ABOUT.md) for details)
* once the above files are done, make a pull request to get your 
  information merged into the main repo
* star this repo to show your appreciation (optional)

We will periodically run a script that will pull your info and populate 
the lower section of this README.md file.
